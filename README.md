MOPAC-FGC: MOPAC Wrapper Implementing PM6-FGC Corrections
=========================================================

MOPAC-FGC implements the PM6-FGC method, a semiempirical quantum-mechanical computational method that augments PM6 with functional group corrections (FGC). It acts as a wrapper calling a modified version of MOPAC, to which it provides the FGC correction.
