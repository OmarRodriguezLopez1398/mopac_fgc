This directory contains reference data that has been used to suppress erratic behavior observed in semiempirical models.

It includes pairs of data points combining physical reference data with erroneous geometries that are given an energetic
penalty to drive the model fitting towards destabilizing them.

It also includes a large and relatively crude set of energies for core-core collisions calculated from density functional theory.
