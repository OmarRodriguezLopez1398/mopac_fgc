# Electrostatic potentials

This directory contains two methods (ESP & PMEP) for mapping the density matrix produced by AM1
calculations to an electrostatic potential that attempts to match *ab initio* Hartree-Fock 
calculations. This methods are considered to be outdated and may be removed from future versions
of MOPAC.
