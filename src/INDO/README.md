# INDO spectroscopy model

This directory contains an implementation of the INDO/S model and excited state calculations
using the INDO/S model Hamiltonian with electron correlation treated at various levels of theory.

The software in this directory was written by Rebecca Gieseking. It was derived and adapted from
the CNDO/INDO program written by Jeff Reimers [DOI:10.4231/D3R49G96G], which was in turn derived
and adapted from the CNDO/S program [QCPE 174] written by J. Del Bene, H. H. Jaffe, R. L. Ellis,
and G. Kuehnlenz.
