# Configuration Interaction

This directory contains the inter-determinant matrix elements and core computational routines for
performing truncated configuration interaction (CI) calculations. While not physically meaningful
according to the strictest interpretation of a thermochemitry model (that is only intended to model
heats of formation with Hartree-Fock calculations), these types of calculations are useful for
understanding the sufficiency of these models and the effects of strong correlation in certain
situations such as bond breaking and multi-radicals.

As annotated, several subroutines were derived and adapted from Daniel Liotard's contributions to
AMPAC version 2.1 (QCPE No. 506).
