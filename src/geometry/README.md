# Molecular geometry calculations & transformations

This directory contains some basic subroutines for transforming molecular geometries
between coordinate systems and calculating some derived geometric quantities.

As noted in the source, `dihed.F90` was derived and adapted from software written by
Walter Thiel, and `gmetry.F90` was derived and adapted from software written by Michael Dewar.
The provenance of this software is not completely clear, but it is likely to have come from
either the MINDO/3 or MNDO programs.
