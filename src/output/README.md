# Output file processing

This directory contains functionality for the processing of output files. Much of the standard
`.out` file is printed by `writmo.F90`, and the machine-readable `.aux` file is printed by
`to_screen.F90`.

The energy decomposition in `enpart.F90` was a contribution to the original MNDO program written by
Santiago Olivella.
