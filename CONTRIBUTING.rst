Contributing to MOPAC
=====================

MOPAC is an open source project and, as such, contributions are welcome and appreciated.
The standard, minimal legal stipulations apply: all contributions must be provided under
the LGPL 3.0 license and all contributors must agree to the DCO by using their real name
and a valid email address in their git commit statements.

How to contribute
=================

Please create a GitHub `Issue <https://github.com/openmopac/mopac/issues/new>`_ for bug
reports and feature requests.

The preferred method of code contribution is to fork the project on
`GitHub <https://github.com/openmopac/mopac>`_, make your changes in a feature branch
starting from the main branch, and then create a pull request. Contributions from outside
of version control will be considered, but they are not preferred. MOPAC does not presently
have strong stylistic or structural requirements, but contributions are encouraged to
conform to the existing codebase as much as possible.

Open pull requests are also welcome, where a pull request is made before a contribution
is ready to be merged, to open up an active dialogue between the core developers and the
contributor about details of the contribution in development. This mode of operation is
particularly useful when a pull request is linked with an issue articulating a problem
that the pull request intends to solve.

While not a strict requirement, code contributions should pass all available tests,
either as they are or with their reference outputs adjusted with an explanation
for why they needed to be adjusted. Contributions may be delayed or rejected if they
fail a test in a meaningful way that is not straightforward to correct.

Historically, major feature contributions to MOPAC were required to be preceded by a journal
publication to maintain clear attribution. While this is no longer necessary for open-source
software developed under automated version control, it is still encouraged.

Major feature contributions should include new tests that cover standard use cases of the
new feature, and corresponding additions to the manual [https://openmopac.github.io],
particularly if new keywords are introduced.

What to contribute
==================

Many types of contributions are welcome:

- bug reports (preferably with a representative example)
- new tests
- new features
- performance improvements
- code quality improvements
- feature requests
